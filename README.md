# Fair Resume Ranker

A human-centered AI tool that ranks resumes fairly and transparently using NLP and fairness-aware algorithms.

## 🚀 About the Project

This project tackles bias in automated resume screening systems. It includes:

- ✅ Resume parsing using NLP (`spaCy`)
- ✅ Candidate profile summarization
- ✅ Fair ranking using models like Logistic Regression with `Fairlearn` or `AIF360`
- ✅ Interpretability using SHAP/LIME
- ✅ Optional UI using Streamlit

## 🔍 Goals

- Build a prototype that demonstrates fair, explainable resume ranking
- Learn core concepts of algorithmic fairness

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **scikit-learn**
- **Fairlearn**, **AIF360**
- **spaCy** or **HuggingFace Transformers**
- **SHAP** or **LIME** for explainability
- **Streamlit** *(for UI – optional)*
- **GitHub** *(code publishing & versioning)*
